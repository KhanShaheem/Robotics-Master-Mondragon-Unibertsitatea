# Academic-Projects

Hi, 

I'm Shaheem! I'm a student in EIT Manufacturing Master "People and Robots for Sustainable Work" degree.

This is a double degree in Robotics & Control systems from Mondragon Unibertsitatea and Mechanical Engineering from Vienna University of Technology.

This repo contains the major projects delivered during my studies as a Robotics masters student in Mondragon University.

Additionally, I would like to thank my peers and the contributors to this repo, namely, Jon Aztiria Oiartzabal, Alejandro Barcena Martinez, Ander Brocal PeÑagaricano, Jon Martin Goñi and Julen Arza MuÑoz.
